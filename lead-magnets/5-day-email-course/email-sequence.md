## Email 1: The Networking Mindset Shift

**Subject Line:** Day 1: The networking mistake that's holding you back

**Preview Text:** Why most professionals network wrong (and the simple fix)

---

Hey {{first_name}},

Welcome to Day 1 of the LUME Method.

Let's start with a truth bomb: **Most networking advice is backwards.**

You've probably heard things like:
- "Collect as many business cards as possible"
- "Always be closing"
- "Your network is your net worth" (so go meet more people!)

This creates a transactional mindset. You're mentally calculating what you can extract from every conversation.

People sense this. It's why networking events feel awkward.

**Here's the mindset shift:**

Stop asking "What can this person do for me?"

Start asking "How can I be useful to this person?"

That's it. Simple, but not easy.

When you approach every interaction looking for ways to give value first, everything changes:
- Conversations feel natural, not forced
- People remember you (because you helped them)
- Opportunities come to you (because givers attract)

**Today's exercise:**

Think of 3 people you've met recently. For each one, identify ONE way you could be helpful to them. It could be:
- An article that relates to something they mentioned
- An introduction to someone in your network
- A solution to a problem they're facing

Send at least one of those messages today. No ask attached. Just value.

Tomorrow, we'll dig into exactly what value YOU have to offer (more than you think).

## Email 2: Your Value Stack

**Subject Line:** Day 2: What you have to offer (it's more than you think)

**Preview Text:** Discover your unique networking currency

---

Hey {{first_name}},

Day 2 - let's talk about YOUR value.

The most common thing I hear from professionals:

"I'm not sure what I have to offer to senior people / successful founders / industry leaders."

This is imposter syndrome talking. Let me show you why it's wrong.

**Everyone has a "Value Stack" - unique things they can offer:**

**1. Knowledge & Expertise**
- Industry insights from your specific role/sector
- Skills you've developed (technical or soft)
- Unique perspective from your background

**2. Connections**
- People you know (regardless of their "status")
- Access to communities or groups
- Relationships in specific industries

**3. Resources**
- Time and attention
- Recommendations (books, tools, services)
- Information others don't have

**4. Energy & Support**
- Being a good listener
- Thoughtful questions that help people think
- Genuine encouragement

Here's the insight: **A junior professional can absolutely provide value to a CEO.**

Maybe you understand TikTok better than they do. Maybe you know great candidates for roles they're hiring. Maybe you recently read a book that applies to their challenge. Maybe you just ask a question that makes them think differently.

**Today's exercise:**

Write down your Value Stack. List at least 3 items in each category:
- Knowledge & Expertise I have:
- Connections I can make:
- Resources I can share:
- How I show up for people:

Keep this list. Reference it before every networking interaction.

Tomorrow: How to have conversations that actually build connection.

## Email 3: The Art of Quality Conversations

**Subject Line:** Day 3: The conversation framework that builds real rapport

**Preview Text:** Stop small talk. Start real connection.

---

Hey {{first_name}},

Day 3 - time to level up your conversations.

**The goal of networking isn't to talk about yourself.** It's to make the other person feel heard, understood, and valued.

Here's how:

**The 70/30 Rule**

Listen 70% of the time. Talk 30% (or less).

Most people do the opposite. They wait for their turn to speak. Don't be most people.

**Questions That Open Doors**

Skip "What do you do?" and try:

- "What are you working on right now that excites you?"
- "What's the biggest challenge in your world these days?"
- "How did you end up in [their field]?"
- "What's something you're trying to figure out?"

These questions invite real answers, not rehearsed elevator pitches.

**The Follow-Up Question**

The magic is in the follow-up.

When someone shares something, dig deeper:
- "Tell me more about that..."
- "What made you decide to...?"
- "How did that feel when...?"

This shows you're actually listening, not just waiting.

**The Bridge**

Once you understand what matters to them, you can offer value:
- "That reminds me of something..."
- "Have you ever tried...?"
- "I know someone who..."
- "I recently read something about that..."

**Today's exercise:**

In your next conversation (professional or personal), practice:
1. Asking one of the "door opener" questions above
2. Following up with at least 2 deeper questions
3. Finding one way to offer value based on what they shared

Notice how the conversation feels different.

Tomorrow: The follow-up system that turns conversations into relationships.

## Email 4: The Follow-Up Formula

**Subject Line:** Day 4: Why most people fail at follow-up (and how to fix it)

**Preview Text:** Turn one conversation into a lasting relationship

---

Hey {{first_name}},

Day 4 - let's talk about where most networking dies.

You meet someone interesting. Great conversation. Exchange contacts.

Then... nothing. You mean to follow up, but life gets busy. Days turn into weeks. Now it's awkward.

Sound familiar?

**The Follow-Up Formula:**

**Timing: Within 48 hours**

The connection is still warm. They remember you. Don't wait.

**Content: Reference + Value**

Structure your follow-up like this:

1. **Reference something specific** from your conversation
2. **Add some value** (article, intro, resource, insight)
3. **Soft next step** (optional)

**Example:**

> "Hey Sarah - great meeting you at the founder dinner last night. Your insight about hiring product managers from consulting firms really resonated.
>
> I remembered a podcast episode that relates - [link]. The part starting at 15:00 is especially relevant to what you mentioned.
>
> Would love to continue the conversation sometime. Let me know if you're ever up for a coffee."

**The Follow-Up System**

One message isn't a relationship. You need a system:

**Week 1:** Initial follow-up
**Week 3-4:** Share something relevant (article, intro)
**Month 2-3:** Suggest a 1:1 (coffee, call)
**Quarterly:** Light touch (congrats on news, relevant share)

**Tools that help:**

- Use your CRM (or a simple spreadsheet) to track contacts
- Set reminders for follow-ups
- Note details from conversations (mentioned kids, trip, challenge)

**Today's exercise:**

1. Think of 3 people you've met in the last month that you haven't followed up with
2. Send each of them a message using the Reference + Value formula
3. Add them to whatever system you use to track relationships

The fortune is in the follow-up.

Tomorrow: The strategy for building your inner circle.

## Email 5: Building Your Inner Circle

**Subject Line:** Day 5: The 10 relationships that will transform your career

**Preview Text:** Quality over quantity - here's the strategy

---

Hey {{first_name}},

Final day. Let's bring it all together.

**Here's the truth about networking:**

You don't need thousands of connections. You need the right 10-20 people who genuinely champion you.

These are the relationships that:
- Send opportunities your way unprompted
- Make warm introductions that open doors
- Give honest feedback that helps you grow
- Have your back when things get hard

**The Inner Circle Strategy:**

**Step 1: Define Your Ideal Inner Circle**

Who do you want in it? Consider:
- 2-3 mentors (people ahead of you)
- 2-3 peers (people at your level)
- 2-3 "rising stars" (people coming up behind you)
- 2-3 connectors (people who know everyone)
- 2-3 domain experts (people with specific expertise you need)

**Step 2: Identify Target Relationships**

For each category, name 2-3 specific people:
- Some you already know (deepen these)
- Some you want to meet (create a plan)

**Step 3: Build Intentionally**

For existing relationships:
- Schedule regular 1:1s (monthly or quarterly)
- Look for ways to be useful proactively
- Be a genuine champion of their work

For new relationships:
- Find warm paths of introduction
- Provide value before asking for anything
- Move from transactional to relational

**Step 4: Maintain Over Years**

Great relationships compound. Stay in touch even when you don't need anything. Be the person who shows up consistently.

**Your 5-Day Summary:**

1. **Mindset:** Give first, always
2. **Clarity:** Know your Value Stack
3. **Engagement:** Listen more, ask better questions
4. **Systems:** Follow up within 48 hours, nurture quarterly
5. **Strategy:** Build an intentional inner circle

**Today's exercise:**

Map out your ideal Inner Circle:
- Who's already in it?
- Who do you want to add?
- What's one action you can take this week to deepen one of these relationships?
